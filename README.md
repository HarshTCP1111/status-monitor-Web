## 📡 About This Project

**Upptime** ([upptime.js.org](https://upptime.js.org)) is the open-source uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by GitHub Actions, Issues, and Pages.  
This setup is a customized deployment managed by me to monitor critical services under my automation projects.

> — CSS Tricks

Used by **3,000+ developers and teams** worldwide.
